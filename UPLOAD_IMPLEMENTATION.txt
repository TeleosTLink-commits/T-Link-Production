IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE: SDS and COA File Upload
==================================================

CHANGES MADE:

FRONTEND (SampleInventory.tsx):
1. Added file upload state variables for COA and SDS files
2. Replaced checkbox inputs with file upload inputs in the modal form
3. Updated handleSubmit to upload COA and SDS files after creating/updating samples
4. Updated handleViewSds to download SDS files from backend (fallback to DOW search)
5. Shows file selection status and existing file indicators

BACKEND (sampleInventory.ts):
1. Added multer configuration for file uploads (10MB limit, PDF/DOC only)
2. Added POST /api/sample-inventory/:id/coa/upload endpoint
3. Added POST /api/sample-inventory/:id/sds/upload endpoint  
4. Updated GET /api/sample-inventory/:id/sds/download to serve actual files
5. Files stored in: backend/uploads/sample-documents/

DATABASE MIGRATION REQUIRED:
Run this SQL to add the new columns:
  psql -h localhost -U [your_user] -d tlink_db -f "c:\T_Link\database\migrations\add_coa_sds_file_columns.sql"

Or run manually:
  ALTER TABLE samples ADD COLUMN coa_file_path VARCHAR(500);
  ALTER TABLE samples ADD COLUMN coa_file_name VARCHAR(255);
  ALTER TABLE samples ADD COLUMN sds_file_path VARCHAR(500);
  ALTER TABLE samples ADD COLUMN sds_file_name VARCHAR(255);

HOW IT WORKS:
- When adding/editing a sample, users can now upload COA and SDS files
- Files are automatically uploaded after the sample is saved
- Clicking the  CoA or  SDS buttons will download the uploaded files
- If no SDS file exists, it falls back to DOW's search page
- File upload accepts PDF and DOC formats only
