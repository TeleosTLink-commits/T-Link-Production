IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
======================

BACKEND CHANGES:
1. Updated c:\T_Link\backend\src\routes\coa.ts
   - Added endpoint: GET /coa/lot/:lotNumber/download
   - Added endpoint: GET /coa/:id/download
   - These endpoints allow downloading CoA files by lot number or ID
   - Include audit logging for downloads

FRONTEND CHANGES:
2. Updated c:\T_Link\frontend\src\pages\SampleInventory.tsx
   - Added handleViewCoa() function: Downloads and opens CoA for a sample's lot number
   - Added handleViewSds() function: Opens DOW's SDS search page for the chemical
   - Updated Status column: Replaced static badges with clickable buttons
     * CoA badge   CoA button (opens CoA document)
     * SDS badge   SDS button (opens SDS search)

HOW IT WORKS:
- When a user clicks the CoA button, it calls the backend API with the lot number
- The backend fetches the CoA file from certificates_of_analysis table
- The file is downloaded and opened in a new browser tab
- When a user clicks the SDS button, it opens DOW's SDS search page with the chemical's CAS number or name

NOTE: The SDS functionality currently redirects to DOW's external search page.
For full SDS file storage/retrieval, you would need to:
1. Create an SDS table in the database similar to certificates_of_analysis
2. Add file upload functionality for SDS documents
3. Create download endpoints similar to the CoA endpoints
